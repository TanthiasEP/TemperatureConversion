//Let's set up a variable to store our tempeature. We'll
//keep this variable constant, as we won't update it. If

//We'll convert Kelvin to Celsius, which is 273 less. We
//won't be changing this degree either, so we use constant.

//Next up we'll convert Celsius to Fahrenheit. We'll be
//rounding, so we'll use let to declare this variable.
